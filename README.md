## PHP Namespace Monkey for Sublime Text

#### Never write a PHP namespace declaration again.

The namespace monkey pre-fills all created PHP files in a Composer-enabled project with a namespace declaration and optionally an empty class definition so you don't have to.

*You can save literally seconds every day thanks to this package.*

Set up the namespace declaration style and turn the class definitions on and off in the package settings.
